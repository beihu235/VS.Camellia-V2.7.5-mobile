# <div align="center">Friday Night Funkin': Never2x</div>
<div align="center">
  
***An engine for rhythm game players, and by rhythm game players.***

![](https://foxdoiguacu.s-ul.eu/9jBOgfuH)

Never2x is meant to keep up with most osu!mania/Etterna charts, as Vs. Camellia demanded these heavily with how their charts are built.<br>
It offers a smooth and intuitive gameplay loop while keeping sync in check, all while trying to bring something new to the FNF space.

As for modding capabilities, it's very similar to how Psych Engine works. The source code was completely written and rethought from scratch, and is meant to offer both hard and soft modding (much like Psych); however hard modding is its main priority.

It's (currently) available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.<br>Mobile support is not planned, and most likely will never be.

To start compiling, refer to [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md).

## Note Quantization
Note colours will change colour depending on where they're placed in the chart.<br>
Can help immensely with timings if you're struggling to figure out when to hit.

## Modcharting
Do keep in mind:

Even though this system is fairly similar to something like NotITG, it's not its main focus; meaning it might be more limiting than what you're looking for.<br>
If this project doesn't fit for you, I suggest looking at other engines like [Troll Engine](https://github.com/riconuts/FNF-Troll-Engine) or [What in the Funkin'?!](https://github.com/Hazardous2468/What-In-The-Funkin).

## Reworked Sustain Inputs
Like in Etterna, they're now based on a coyote-timer based system; instead of missing immediately upon releasing the sustain.

## Multi-file Support
The project supports more than the FNF legacy format. It also supports StepMania Shark (.ssc), osu!mania (.osu) and StepMania (.sm), offering easy playtesting without requiring having to convert the chart yourself.
