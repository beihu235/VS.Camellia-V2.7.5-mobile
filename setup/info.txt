you need haxe and git before doing anything on here

we use 4.2.5 for haxe at least but 4.3.0 works too

4.2.5: https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/
4.3.0 or later (i use 4.3.1): https://haxe.org/download/version/4.3.0/

for git just get it from https://git-scm.com
kind of confusing process but i basically just
clicked ok on everything

windows only
after installing those you run `msvs-dependency.bat`
and then `libraries-windows.bat`

for unix (mac/linux) you don't need `msvs-dependency.bat` but can just run `libraries-unix.sh`

after everything is installed
open a command prompt window in the project's directory 
(should be `C:/Users/User/Desktop/Vs-Camellia` for example mine's `C:/Users/Rudyrue/Desktop/nuhuh/Vs-Camellia`)
and type `lime test cpp`
